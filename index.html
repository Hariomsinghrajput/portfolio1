      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Hariom Kumar, and I'm currently pursuing my
        B.Tech in the ECE branch at SKIT(Jaipur). I'm currently in my 3rd year of
        studies. One thing you should know about me is that I have an insatiable
        curiosity for learning new things, which keeps me constantly engaged in
        discovering and exploring various subjects. When I'm not buried in my
        studies or coding projects, you can find me satisfying my wanderlust by
        traveling to new places and experiencing different cultures. Sports also
        hold a special place in my heart, and I love playing volleyball whenever
        I get the chance. I have my roots in Bihar, specifically from the Rohtas
        district, where I completed my primary and secondary education. These
        experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual with a passion
        for education, adventure, and sports. I'm excited to see where my
        journey leads me next!
